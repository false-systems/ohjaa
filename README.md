# ohjaa

**Steering knowledge for agents, handed to them before they act.** *Ohjaa* is
Finnish for *steer*.

Toimija reports facts and refuses to decide. Ohjaa holds the other half: what
the people an agent works for **know and have decided**. That covers the
decisions, facts, taste and lessons that
[`faija-ontology.v2`](https://github.com/false-systems/faija) calls
**Knowledge**. Every agent launched through ohjaa starts with that Knowledge,
followed by context for its launch repository and declared scope. The full
fleet remains available on demand.

```bash
ohjaa run claude --intent "…"          # brief the agent, then hand off to toimija
ohjaa brief                            # the briefing an agent gets here
ohjaa brief --scope ../other-repo       # retrieve context after expanding scope
ohjaa propose --scope ours --id rust-only --kind decision \
      --origin "2026-09-16: 'we dont do python'" "Code is Rust or Elixir/Erlang."
ohjaa review                           # a person decides what becomes current
ohjaa intake                           # draft proposals from what people said
ohjaa report                           # what went around the workflow this week
ohjaa check                            # validate, and flag what may no longer hold
ohjaa session                          # the record of the last ended session here, or of one by id
ohjaa graph rust-only                  # a node, its neighbours, who was briefed with it
ohjaa fleet                            # who is live, across every repo
ohjaa system                           # what every tool in the fleet is, derived now
ohjaa apply                            # apply the workflow from ~/.config/ohjaa, outside every repo
ohjaa adopt ~/projects/sykli           # give a repo an entry: its branch and its gate
ohjaa doctor                           # what differs from what apply would make it
ohjaa gate                             # run this repo's gate, as a push will judge it
```

## Why

Between April and September 2026, a person corrected coding agents about 151
times. The corrections break down roughly like this:

- **~60%:** the agent did not know the person's world: current names, the Lima
  VM, "Rust only", "products stand alone".
- **~26%:** the agent overstepped.
- **~10%:** the agent stalled, because it could not tell what was safe.

The top five corrections alone recurred about 70 times. A correction you have
to repeat is Knowledge that failed to reach the agent. Ohjaa is where that
Knowledge lives and how it reaches the agent.

## Knowledge

One node per file, in the [`knowledge-node.v1`](https://github.com/false-systems/faija/blob/main/docs/knowledge-node-v1.md)
format: TOML frontmatter, then the body an agent reads.

```
+++
id = "lima-for-linux"
kind = "fact"
status = "current"
as_of = 2026-09-24
origin = ["15 corrections, 2026-05-28 to 2026-09-05: 'we have lima'"]
holds_while = ["command:limactl"]
+++
Linux and eBPF builds and tests run in the Lima VM. Never report them as
blocked on macOS.
```

A node's scope, meaning whose it is, is the directory it lives in:

| Scope | Lives in | Changes by |
|---|---|---|
| ours | `<shared checkout>/knowledge/`, set by `OHJAA_OURS` or `~/.config/ohjaa/ours` | pull request |
| repo | `<repo>/.ohjaa/knowledge/` | pull request |
| mine | `~/.config/ohjaa/mine/` | you |
| machine | `~/.config/ohjaa/machine/` | you |

The launch repository's briefing is ordered **ours → repo → mine → machine**, then **decision →
fact → taste → lesson**. A personal node can never supersede a shared one, and
shared Knowledge never builds on personal Knowledge. Those rules come from
faija's contract, and ohjaa carries its reference implementation in
`vendor/faija-knowledge`.

Every explicitly scoped repository also contributes its complete repo knowledge,
labelled with its path. Global knowledge is delivered once, not repeated for each
repo. No keyword matcher drops a decision. Session records preserve the repository
identity of delivered repo nodes; older records without that identity still read.

## Agents propose, a person decides

- `ohjaa propose` writes a proposal to `~/.local/state/ohjaa/proposals/`,
  **outside every repository**. An agent's draft never lands in a shared repo
  by itself.
- `ohjaa review`, `accept`, `reject`, `retire` and `confirm` refuse to run
  without an interactive terminal, and agents run without one.
- Accepting a node that supersedes another marks the old node `superseded` in
  the same step, and refuses outright if the result would not hold together.
  Nothing is deleted: retired and superseded Knowledge keeps its time and its
  why.
- Shared Knowledge (ours, repo) is then committed and reviewed in a pull
  request, like code. For shared scopes that review is the real gate.

**How strong the person-only guard is:** it stops a careless agent, which is
the kind the correction history shows. It does not stop a determined one. A
program can fake a terminal, so for personal scopes the terminal check is a
line an honest agent does not cross, not a lock.

## Intake: corrections become proposals

```bash
ohjaa intake                                  # from where the last run stopped
ohjaa intake --since 2026-04-01 --max-batches 50
ohjaa intake --source transcripts --dry-run   # show the prompt, send nothing
```

`ohjaa intake` reads four sources:

- **Transcripts:** Claude Code and Codex sessions, keeping only what the person
  typed.
- **Reviews:** human comments on pull requests and issues, through `gh`.
- **Reverts:** reverted commits.
- **Report:** what the bypass report finds (see below).

It sends them in batches to a **drafter**, an agent CLI that reads a prompt on
stdin and prints a JSON array. The default is `claude -p`; override it with
`--drafter` or `~/.config/ohjaa/drafter`. The drafter sees the existing
Knowledge. When a correction repeats something already known, it drafts a
**lesson** that refines that node rather than a duplicate, and that is how a
node that is not reaching agents gets noticed.

Every draft is validated like any proposal, and an invalid one is refused out
loud. The cursor moves only past what was actually drafted from.

## The bypass report: what went around the workflow

```bash
ohjaa report                    # the last 7 days
ohjaa report --since 30d --json # ohjaa-report.v1
```

`ohjaa report` derives, now, three lists for the window:

- **Sessions without read-back or handover:** ended sessions in the log that
  never ran `ohjaa oriented`, or left no `ohjaa handover`.
- **Commits on a default branch without passing evidence.**
  - For every git repository under the roots, these are the first-parent
    commits its default branch (`origin/<default>`, else the local one)
    gained in the window, by commit time, at most 100 per repository.
  - Each is checked with `sykli verify --commit` against every receipt of its
    tree, in every checkout and under the git common dir. It passes when any
    one of them verifies.
  - Listed: what sykli refused, and what was never run in a checkout that
    still exists.
  - The rest are counted by why: verified; no sykli contract; made in a
    checkout that is gone, with no receipt kept (merge commits among them);
    sykli could not say. A window over the cap is said.
- **Agent sessions a person started without ohjaa:** with `vessa` on PATH,
  the top-level Claude and Codex sessions `vessa sessions --json` lists in
  the window that no `ohjaa run` launched.
  - A session belongs to a launch when the launch's usage receipt names it,
    or when it is the same agent, in the launch's repository or below,
    started within a minute after the launch. Each launch claims one.
  - Headless runs bypass nothing and are only counted: `claude -p`
    (`entrypoint` `sdk-…`), `codex exec` (`originator` naming exec), and
    intake's own drafter with them.
  - A session vessa could not date or place is listed apart, not judged.
  - A vessa that does not say how sessions were started (no `entrypoint` or
    `originator`, before vessa#2) leaves the list not judged.

Every warning vessa gives about what it read, a vessa exit other than 0 or
4, an undated session, a capped window, and a root with no repositories is
a gap. A report with gaps says them, and exits 4: it is never a clean week.

Once a week, at an `ohjaa run` a person starts at a terminal, the report is
read while the agent works, and three lines of it are said after the
session's record, never in the agent's briefing. The week is marked only
when that report was complete. One with a gap is said again at most once a
day, and its last line says what the gap is, so it can be fixed (for
example `incomplete: vessa lacks session origins — update vessa`). Only
those two times are kept (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/ohjaa/report-at` and
`report-shown-at`), like intake's cursor. `ohjaa report` records them too,
but only when it printed to a terminal: never for `--json`, a script or an
agent.

```
ohjaa: weekly report, 2026-10-03 to 2026-10-10: 2 session(s) without read-back or handover · 1 commit(s) on a default branch without passing evidence · 1 agent session(s) started without ohjaa
ohjaa:   first: 3dbaafd on origin/main in selko: FAILED sykli verify: refused: outcome …
ohjaa:   `ohjaa report` lists them all; the next summary is in 7 days.
```

`ohjaa intake` takes the report as its fourth source (`--source report`).
These become `observed` candidates:

- a session that never read back;
- a refused or unchecked commit on a default branch;
- a session a person started without ohjaa.

What could not be checked or judged never does.

## Sessions: entering to leaving

`ohjaa run` runs each agent session through five states, and stays its parent
until it ends so the last one always happens:

```
1 entering → 2 oriented → 3 working, phase 1 … n → 4 finished work → 5 leaving
```

| State | What happens | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 entering | knowledge, the last session here, lifecycle instructions, and scoped context | ohjaa |
| 2 oriented | the agent reads back what it knows: `ohjaa oriented "<goal; rules; who else>"` | the agent |
| 3 working | small phases, each a commit and, where the repo has a sykli contract, a `sykli run` on it | observed from git, `.sykli/receipts` in every checkout `git worktree list` names, and `<git common dir>/sykli/receipts` (the receipt sykli keeps of each push it accepted, which outlives a removed worktree): the commits a reflog (a checkout's HEAD, or a branch) shows created since entering and still reachable, never ones a pull or merge brought in, nor one an amend or rebase replaced (a rebase's replayed commits are made anew, and count). A commit is the session's own only where that can be shown (see below); every other one made meanwhile is recorded as observed, not attributed |
| 4 finished | the pull request of the branch this session's newest commit on a branch was made on (by name, then by commit once a squash merge deleted the branch; when the branch, its worktree and its remote-tracking branch are all gone, even after `git fetch --prune`, its commits made here are found in the object store and the pull request is searched for by the newest: when one holds it they are shown `on no branch now`, otherwise (a stash, say) they are left out; none asked when it made no commit on a branch), and what `sykli verify --commit` says about its head; every commit that reached the default branch during the session, checked the same way | observed through `gh`, git and sykli |
| 5 leaving | the record: observed part, then the handover (`ohjaa handover`) | ohjaa, and the agent's testimony |

States are **observed, not declared**: the agent writes only its read-back and
its handover, and the record shows them as its words. Leaving always writes the
record, crash or not; a missing handover is recorded as none. Only losing ohjaa
itself (a SIGKILL, a crash, a restart) skips leaving: the next launch finds that
ohjaa gone, closes the session as `orphaned (observed at next launch)`, queues it
for `ohjaa intake`, and opens its briefing with it when it ran here. Only the
absence is observed, never a cause, and an orphan ranks by when it started: a
session that really ended after that stays the last session here.

The next session here, and in every repository it named with `--scope` (never
one it was only found working in), is briefed with the last session's record:

```
session oh-1790… · claude · selko · 2026-09-26 10:02 UTC → 2026-09-26 11:47 UTC · ended: clean (exit 0)
─ observed (written by ohjaa; the agent cannot change it) ─
intent        retry uploads
knew          14 knowledge node(s) delivered · read back at 10:04 UTC
phases        a1b2c3d receipt: passed · d4e5f6a receipt: passed · 0718abc receipt: failed · 9c0d1e2 receipt: passed
finished      https://github.com/…/pull/57 (open) · head 9c0d1e2: verified: passed (sykli verify --commit)
─ handover (the agent's own words) ─
unfinished    Windows paths in uploader/retry.rs
next agent    Dima owns the queue; ask first
surprised by  the fixture helper silently skips when git is missing
```

A receipt's `outcome` is its own claim, and the record says it as one
(`receipt: passed`); a receipt is filed under the tree that ran (a run sykli's
pre-commit hook makes before the commit is that tree's run), and a passing run
outranks a newer failing or dirty one. Only sykli says a commit passed. It is
asked about the pull request's head; about the tip of every push of the
session's that reached the default branch (pushed from here to
`origin/<default>`, or made here and now on the local one; a fetch is not a
landing), which is what a pre-push Boundary gates; and about the commit
`origin/<default>` is left at when a push from this clone put it there,
whoever pushed. The commits before a tip are shown as their receipts' word.
Leaving runs `sykli verify <receipt> --contract sykli.json --commit <sha>` in a
checkout at that commit with nothing beside it, when there is one, else where
the receipt is:

| sykli says | the record says | flag |
|---|---|---|
| exit 0 | `verified: passed` | no |
| refused the commit's own run (another tree, a dirty run, a failed outcome, contradictory records) | `FAILED sykli verify: …` | **yes** |
| exit 1, 3 or 4, by a sykli that reads everything from the commit (sykli#67 as merged; its help says "nothing is read from the checkout") | `FAILED sykli verify: …` | **yes** |
| refused the tree, inputs or contract on disk, by an older sykli in a checkout that is not the commit | `stale: sykli checked the checkout, not the commit` | no |
| exit 2: it could not verify (a bad revision, arguments, not a receipt) | `unverified: sykli verify could not verify: …` | no |
| any other end: a crash, a kill, no answer in time | `unverified: …` | no |
| no `--commit` (`sykli verify --help` does not name it) | `unverified: sykli has no --commit` | no |
| — the commit has no sykli contract | `unverified: no sykli contract …` | no |
| — no receipt names the commit's tree (the commit has a contract) | `unchecked` | **yes** where it is `origin/<default>`'s tip; otherwise no |
| — no receipt, and the checkout it was made in is gone with its `.sykli/` | `unchecked: … the checkout it was made in is gone` | no: it cannot be observed |

A refusal of the session's own work **flags the record**, and so does the tip
`origin/<default>` was left at when sykli refused it or it was never run where
there is a contract (and the checkout it was made in, where a receipt would be,
still exists): a broken main is the repository's state, whoever pushed it
(another session sharing the clone, a person by hand), so it is said either way,
as `observed, not attributed` when it is not shown to be this session's. Only
the session's own refused work becomes an intake candidate. The record opens
with its flags, leaving ends by saying them again (`ohjaa: flagged: …`), and
the next briefing here, `ohjaa brief` included, opens with them before the
knowledge and before the handover. "`origin/main` at `<sha>`" is said only of
the commit the branch sits at, when the record is written and again when a
briefing is made; once the branch has moved on, the session's own refused
commit is said as having reached it, and a tip it only observed is no longer
said:

```
WARNING from the last session here (oh-1791…, claude, ended 2026-10-09 21:30 UTC):
- origin/main at 3dbaafd in selko has no passing evidence — check before building on it (FAILED sykli verify: refused: outcome expected passed …)
```

An earlier session's flag about a branch here keeps opening the briefing for as
long as that branch still sits at the commit it flagged (`WARNING from an
earlier session here (…), still true`), so a quiet session in between cannot
hide a broken main; so does one a root session saw in a repository it only
found (`WARNING from a session that observed this repository`). Each tip is
said once.

The records live in a **session log**, redb at
`~/.local/state/ohjaa/sessions.redb`, on this machine only. Knowledge never
lives there, so deleting the log loses no knowledge. A busy or broken log never
blocks a launch; a broken one is reported and left alone, never replaced.
`ohjaa intake` drafts proposals from each ended session once: its handover,
what was said in its window, and what ohjaa observed going wrong in it (source
`observed`): its own work that sykli refused at the default branch or a pull
request head (never what could not be checked, nor what is not shown to be the
session's); a non-zero exit; a missing handover; an orphaned session. Those are
facts, not anyone's words, and the drafter is told so.

Signals, while a session runs (unix):

- **Ctrl-C** reaches the agent directly (it is in the same process group).
  ohjaa survives it and never passes it on: a second Ctrl-C makes agents like
  `claude` quit instead of interrupt.
- **SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2** sent to ohjaa are survived and
  passed on to the session once each. To stop a session from outside, send
  SIGTERM to ohjaa.
- **After the session ends**, any of these cuts leaving short (the tools still
  running are killed) and the record is still written, with what was known by
  then; the normal dispositions come back once it is saved.
- **SIGKILL** cannot be caught: it loses the record.

## Session usage

Usage stays in the existing session log. It is **imported source testimony**,
separate from ohjaa's observed work and from provider billing. No new service,
database or sibling-repository dependency is required.

```bash
# A local collector such as Vessa creates a native-session snapshot.
vessa receipt --input /path/to/session.jsonl > /tmp/session-usage.json
ohjaa usage import /tmp/session-usage.json --session oh-EXISTING-ID
ohjaa usage export > /tmp/ohjaa-sessions.json
```

Inside a run, `usage import` defaults to `OHJAA_SESSION`. To pick up a receipt
automatically when the agent command ends, use `ohjaa run ... --usage-file
/path/to/fresh-receipt.json`. Ohjaa passes that path as `OHJAA_USAGE_FILE`; the
launched command or its wrapper must write an `agent-usage.v1` receipt there,
and its `agent` must be the basename of the command ohjaa launched (a wrapper
launched as the agent claims its own name, not `claude`). A refused receipt is
recorded as `refused: <reason>`, never as not collected.
Native agent transcripts are not that receipt format. Existing paths are
refused so an old receipt cannot be accidentally reused. Missing/invalid
receipts are reported and never change the agent's exit status. No automatic
time-window or directory matching is performed between concurrent sessions.

For Codex launches, ohjaa also passes the generated `OHJAA_SESSION`, the
resolved `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and optional `OHJAA_USAGE_FILE` through per-session
`shell_environment_policy.set` overrides. Codex tool commands can run in a
persistent daemon that did not inherit the wrapper environment. Toimija passes
its own handshake independently. Neither wrapper modifies global Codex config
or relaxes environment filtering or sandbox permissions. Existing sessions need
a fresh wrapped launch; no session is recovered by guessing from directory or
time. See [Codex's configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference/).

`agent-usage.v1` is a cumulative snapshot of one native session. It contains
`agent`, `session_id`, `source`, `observed_at_ms`, `complete`, `limitations`,
and `entries` grouped by `provider` and `model`. Each entry has nullable
`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`,
`estimated_usd_micros`, `estimate_basis`, `credits` and `billed`. Input excludes
cache categories. An amount is `{unit, micros, source}`: credit units are
provider-specific; billed units are currencies. `null` means unknown, never
zero. Estimates require their rate basis; amounts require their source.

Imports validate the shape and agent, not the truth of a provider claim.
Repeating an identical snapshot changes nothing; a newer snapshot replaces
the earlier one, rather than adding its cumulative totals. Stale/conflicting
snapshots are refused. A native session can belong to only one wrapper
session; after resuming it, update that original association rather than
double-attribute its entire history to a second run. This first contract does
not split a native session's consumption across several wrapper runs.

`usage export` emits `ohjaa-sessions.v1`, with `sessions` and `unreadable`.
Unreadable records produce exit 4. `--session ID` selects one record. Existing
records without usage remain readable and explicitly show "not collected".
Exports contain private session context; choose their destination accordingly.

## Keeping it true

`ohjaa check` validates every node and the rules across them. It also flags
what may no longer hold:

- a `holds_while` predicate that is false right now;
- a **fact** not re-confirmed for 90 days (`ohjaa confirm <id>`);
- a briefing longer than an agent will reliably read (8,000 characters). The
  fix is to merge or retire nodes, never to truncate.

A flag never hides a node. The briefing shows it with the flag beside it.

For agents not launched through ohjaa, `ohjaa brief --write <file>` writes the
Knowledge as a generated block into an instruction file such as `CLAUDE.md` or
`AGENTS.md`, and leaves everything else in the file alone.

## The fleet and the perimeter

`ohjaa system` derives what every tool in the fleet is, from each repo's own
`.toimija/repo.yaml`. `ohjaa fleet` reports who is live, from `toimija
sessions` in each repo and `toimija sessions --outside-repos` for the sessions
running outside any repo (listed under "outside any repository", by folder).
Both are **derived now, stored never**: a derived view cannot be staler than
the moment it was computed. `ohjaa run` and `ohjaa brief` include only the launch
repository and repositories named by `--scope`, after the Knowledge. Sessions
outside repositories are included when they are in the launch folder or their
declared scope reaches a selected repository. Other repositories are explicitly
unobserved; `ohjaa system` and `ohjaa fleet` still derive the full fleet.

`run` reuses its launch preflight scans when composing the briefing. It does not
ask Toimija for every repository's context or repeat the session scans. Coverage
failures remain visible and selected-repository launch checks still refuse to
launch blind. `brief --scope PATH` can retrieve context when a task grows; it
does not declare session scope, so declare it with `toimija intent` before work.
Missing scope repositories produce exit 4 from `brief`, never an empty success.

The briefing tells an agent to use delivered facts instead of repeating discovery.
With no concrete task, it acknowledges and waits: the wrapper already recorded
entry. Orientation precedes the first task change; handover belongs at work
completion or session exit, not after every conversational reply. No knowledge
is truncated to save tokens, and no new index, database or model call is needed.

The root list is derived as the sibling directories of your git root (outside
a repo, the folder you are in), unless `~/.config/ohjaa/roots` or `--root`
overrides it. A root that does not exist is an error, never an empty fleet.

## Two agents, one checkout

```bash
# terminal 1
ohjaa run codex --intent "change the parser" --task "fix the lexer" --scope src/parser/
# terminal 2, same directory
ohjaa run claude --intent "refresh the guide"
# everything after `--` reaches the agent command itself
ohjaa run codex --intent "change the parser" -- --model o3
```

- Each agent gets its own toimija session.
- Knowledge and lifecycle context travel as `toimija run --briefing`, separately
  from `--task`. With an updated Toimija, an idle Codex launch opens without a
  model acknowledgement turn; the first user message still receives the briefing.
  Explicit tasks and other agents retain prompt delivery. Update Toimija before
  using this version of Ohjaa; older versions reject the new flag rather than
  silently dropping context.
- `--dry-run` prints the exact command it would exec, without launching.
- If toimija cannot fully read the sessions, or does not report its coverage,
  ohjaa refuses to launch blind.

## Agents launched from the root

Launch agents from the folder that holds your repositories, and name the ones
each agent will work in with `--scope`:

```bash
cd ~/projects
ohjaa run claude --intent "rename the flag everywhere" --scope ~/projects/a --scope ~/projects/b
```

ohjaa briefs it with your Knowledge, each scoped repo's Knowledge and context,
and the last session in this folder. With no repository selected, it adds no
repository roster. It hands the session to toimija, which opens it outside every repo: no
packet, but visible — `ohjaa fleet` lists it under "outside any repository".
Every repository named with `--scope` is treated like the one a session is
launched in:

- **at launch**, ohjaa counts the sessions live in each scoped repo, and
  refuses to launch blind if it cannot read them;
- **at leaving**, it records, per scoped repo, the commits the agent made there
  (with what sykli saw on each) and the branch's pull request;
- **the other way round**, a session launched inside a repo counts the sessions
  from the root whose `--scope` names it (`ohjaa fleet` lists them under
  "outside any repository", with their scope);
- **the next agent there** is briefed with it: "the last session here" is the
  one that ended last, launched in that repo or elsewhere with a `--scope`
  naming it, and one launched elsewhere says where it was launched.

**Observed, not asserted (law 3).** One rule: in a repository the session was
launched in or named with `--scope`, a commit made during the session is its
own unless another session was there at that second — in the checkout it was
launched in, a session launched in that checkout; in any other checkout or
branch of the clone, old or new, any session in the clone (sessions in the log,
and live ones toimija saw at launch). Only its own commits are its phases, its
pull request and its lessons. Everything else made during the session is
recorded as `observed … not attributed`, with the session it shared the place
with (`shared with oh-… in work, …`). Known limit: a person's own commit in a
place the session holds alone looks exactly like the agent's, and is credited
to the session.

A repository nobody named is observed when a commit was made in it: at leaving,
ohjaa looks at the repositories directly in the launch folder (and in any folder
`--scope` named that is not itself a repository), and records each where a
commit was made, or pushed from, during the session, in any of its worktrees,
as **found, not named**. Nothing in a found repository is attributed to the
session: it is not its phases or lessons, no pull request is looked up, and the
session never becomes that repository's "last session here" (a broken main it
saw there is still said, as the repository's state). Name repositories with
`--scope` wherever you can. A `--scope` path that is neither in a repository
nor a folder is named as unobserved. Scope can be named from inside a repo too, for
a second repository an agent will touch.

A toimija too old to list sessions outside repos makes ohjaa refuse to launch
from the root, and makes `ohjaa fleet` incomplete — never quietly empty.

## Coverage is a fact

A scan that failed is not a scan that found nothing:

```
coverage: scanned 17/18 repo(s)
  incomplete — absence here is not evidence of absence:
    somerepo: not a Git repository
```

- `ohjaa fleet` exits `4` when coverage is incomplete.
- A session toimija reports as `stale` stays visible, with its age, because

## The workflow home: applied from outside the repos

The agent workflow (the gate, the hooks, the launcher) is a workflow thing,
not something to merge into product repositories. Ohjaa keeps it in its home
and applies it to repositories from outside; nothing is installed on a
repository or written into one. Only repositories whose remote names an entry
run ohjaa's hooks, and only the hooks they need: `git status`, `commit` and
`fetch` start no ohjaa at all unless the repository has a hook of its own
there, and a Homebrew tap, Cargo's git cache or a personal project never
starts it.

```

  repos/<owner>/<repo>/             lower case
    repo.toml     branch = "main"   the only per-repo workflow fact
    sykli.json    the gate (a sykli contract), inputs repo-relative
    sykli.lock
    hooks/pre-push, hooks/<name>    exec '<ohjaa>' hook <name> "$@": pre-push, and each
                                    hook this entry's clones have of their own
    gated.config                    core.hooksPath = that hooks/ folder

~/.config/git/ignore                git's global excludes (or core.excludesFile):
                                    a block marked "ohjaa apply" holds .sykli/
```

```bash
ohjaa apply --dry-run                  # every change apply would make; makes none
ohjaa apply                            # the home's files, the include, the ignore block, ~/.zshrc
ohjaa apply --undo                     # put back what apply changed; entries, roots, tools.lock stay
ohjaa apply --prune                    # also remove dispatchers no clone needs any more
ohjaa adopt ~/projects/taso            # entry: origin's default branch, and the gate
ohjaa gate                             # run this repo's gate, as a push will judge it
ohjaa gate --print                     # the contract and the commands, run nothing
ohjaa doctor                           # read-only; exits 4 on drift
ohjaa tools pin sykli --from ~/projects/sykli   # pin origin/HEAD's commit and toolchain
ohjaa apply --tools                    # install tools.lock's revisions
```

**Scoped by remote.** Git's global config gets one line, an `include` of
`git/config`. That file has, for each entry, `includeIf
"hasconfig:remote.*.url:…"` sections (git 2.36+) that include the entry's own
`gated.config`, which sets `core.hooksPath` to the entry's own `hooks/`. The
patterns are host-agnostic and case-insensitive (`**/o/r`, `**/o/r.git`,
`**/o/r/`, `**/o/r.git/`, and the same after `*:` for scp-like URLs, plus a
short form for each global `insteadOf` rule), because a pattern that misses
lets a push past the gate, while one that matches too much only costs a
process that finds no entry. Any remote of a clone counts. A `pushurl`, a
repository-local `insteadOf`, or the repository's own `core.hooksPath`
(perusta, selko and vartio set one) is not seen by the patterns: `ohjaa doctor`
checks, clone by clone, that git really resolves `core.hooksPath` to the
entry's hooks, and `ohjaa run` warns at launch in such a repository. The
generated files are written atomically and checked with `git config --file
… --list` first, since an unreadable one would break every git command.

**The dispatcher** (`ohjaa hook <name>`) finds the repository by the URL git
pushes to. On pre-push, with an entry, the push is judged by
`sykli hook pre-push --contract <entry>/sykli.json --branch <entry's branch>
<remote> <url>`, and a refusal stops it. A sykli without both flags, or an
entry without a gate, refuses every push to the entry's branch. Then, for
every hook, the dispatcher runs the repository's own hook,
`<common dir>/hooks/<name>`, with the same arguments and the same stdin, and
exits with its status. `push-to-checkout`, `proc-receive` and
`fsmonitor-watchman` never get a dispatcher, because a file of that name
changes what git does. The dispatchers exec ohjaa, and the pre-push one hands
the gate to sykli, by the paths `apply` found on PATH, so a git client started
without your PATH (a GUI) runs them too.

**Few git processes.** Facts are worked out once and passed down. A hook that
only chains starts no git: git runs it from the work tree's root, and the
common directory comes from the repository's layout. pre-push starts none of
its own either, and hands sykli `--repo-root` and `--git-common-dir` when
sykli takes them. `ohjaa gate` starts one (the repository's config);
`doctor` two for the machine (`git --version`, the global config with
includes) and one per clone (its config, with `insteadOf` applied in Rust).
`tests/config_home.rs` holds these budgets.

**`ohjaa gate`** runs the gate a push will judge, from the repository root:
`mkdir -p .sykli && sykli run <contract> --json > .sykli/receipt.json &&
sykli verify .sykli/receipt.json --contract <contract> --commit HEAD`, where
the contract is the entry's, or the repository's own `sykli.json` when origin
names no entry. It prints the contract and every command, and exits with
sykli's status. Agents are taught this one command.

**`apply`** runs as the `ohjaa` on PATH (anything else is refused unless
`--bin` names it, so a `cargo run` cannot re-point every hook). It refuses,
before changing anything, when git's global `core.hooksPath` is set (in the
global file or a file it includes): it would run in every repository and
override the scoped one; `--force` removes it from the global file. Its first
run that finds repositories writes them down in `roots`, so what it finds
never depends on where it runs, and it only ever adds dispatchers (a spare
costs a process, a missing one silently skips a check); `--prune` removes
spares. Each change is recorded before it is made, so `--undo` can put back
exactly what was there even after an apply that failed. The launcher line it
puts in `~/.zshrc`, in place of the old `source ~/projects/ohjaa-launch.zsh`,
is guarded like that one was: `[[ -x <ohjaa> ]] && eval "$(<ohjaa>
shell-init zsh)"`.

**`adopt`** copies the repository's `sykli.json` and `sykli.lock` as origin's
default branch holds them (not the working tree, which another session may be
editing), or asks `sykli init --contract <entry>/sykli.json` for a new one,
then regenerates `git/` and writes the entry's dispatchers. It never touches
git's global config, and takes no lock in the repository.

**`tools.lock`** pins each tool to a full commit and to the toolchain its
repository's `rust-toolchain.toml` names, because `cargo install --git` builds
with whatever toolchain runs it. `apply --tools` runs
`cargo +<toolchain> install --git <url> --rev <rev> --locked --force <name>`
from an empty temporary directory, only for a tool Cargo's own record
(`~/.cargo/.crates.toml`) does not show at its pin; a tool installed from a
path is *unpinned*.

## What it will never do

- **No messaging between agents, no request/response, no presence.** A message
  from an agent that has since died is a silent lie. Knowledge is not a
  message: it carries its time, its why and whose it is, and a person reviewed
  it.
- **No scheduler and no dispatch.** Claiming work stays in GitHub issues and
  pull requests. A handover is a record for whoever comes next here, shown in
  the next briefing, never a message addressed to a particular agent.
